# How to Use Steam API Register Call Result Function
 
The Steam API provides a way for your game to interact with Steam features and services, such as achievements, leaderboards, cloud storage, and more. One of the functions that you can use in the Steam API is the register call result function, which allows you to receive asynchronous results from Steamworks API calls.

In this article, we will explain what the register call result function is, how it works, and how to use it in your game code.
  
## What is the register call result function?
 
The register call result function is a macro that you can use to declare a callback class that will receive the result of a Steamworks API call. You can identify a function that provides a call result by inspecting its return value; if it returns a SteamAPICall\_t and has a CALL\_RESULT() attribute then you must register to receive the call result[^2^].
 
For example, the ISteamUserStats::RequestUserStats function returns a SteamAPICall\_t and has a CALL\_RESULT() attribute with UserStatsReceived\_t as the parameter. This means that you need to register a callback class that will receive a UserStatsReceived\_t structure when the request is completed.
  
## How does the register call result function work?
 
The register call result function works by creating an instance of CCallResult, which is a template class that handles the registration and unregistration of the callback class. The CCallResult class takes two template parameters: the callback class type and the result type. The callback class type must inherit from CCallbackBase and implement a Run function that takes the result type as a parameter. The result type must be a structure defined by the Steamworks API.
 
When you create an instance of CCallResult, you need to pass a pointer to an instance of your callback class and a SteamAPICall\_t value that represents the API call that you want to receive the result for. The CCallResult class will then register your callback class with Steamworks and store the API call handle. When the API call is completed, Steamworks will invoke your callback class's Run function with the result structure as a parameter. The CCallResult class will also automatically unregister your callback class when it goes out of scope or when you call Cancel on it.
  
## How to use the register call result function?
 
To use the register call result function, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Declare a callback class that inherits from CCallbackBase and implements a Run function that takes the result type as a parameter.
2. Create an instance of CCallResult with your callback class type and the result type as template parameters.
3. Call a Steamworks API function that returns a SteamAPICall\_t and has a CALL\_RESULT() attribute.
4. Pass a pointer to your callback class instance and the returned SteamAPICall\_t value to the CCallResult constructor.
5. Wait for your callback class's Run function to be invoked with the result structure when the API call is completed.

Here is an example of how to use the register call result function with the ISteamUserStats::RequestUserStats function:
  ```cpp // Declare a callback class that inherits from CCallbackBase class CUserStatsCallback : public CCallbackBase  public:     // Implement a Run function that takes UserStatsReceived\_t as a parameter     void Run(UserStatsReceived\_t \*pResult)              // Check if the request was successful         if (pResult->m\_eResult == k\_EResultOK)                      // Do something with the user stats             printf("Received user stats for user %llu\n", pResult->m\_steamIDUser.ConvertToUint64());                  else                      // Handle errors             printf("Failed to receive user stats: %d\n", pResult->m\_eResult);               ;  // Create an instance of CCallResult with CUserStatsCallback and UserStatsReceived\_t as template parameters CCallResult<cuserstatscallback, userstatsreceived_t=""> m_UserStatsCallResult;

// Call RequestUserStats and get a SteamAPICall_t value
SteamAPICall_t hSteamAPICall = SteamUserStats()->RequestUserStats(Steam 0f148eb4a0
